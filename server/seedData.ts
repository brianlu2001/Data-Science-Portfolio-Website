    title: 'Machine Learning: AI Music Detection with Deep Learning',
    simplifiedDescription: `Advanced AI music detection system using deep learning to identify AI-generated music from major generators like Suno and Udio, achieving 90% accuracy.`,
    fullDescription: `The topic of music tech is the perfect intersection between my profession and my lifelong passion. This project, part of UCSB's Data Science Capstone and sponsored by Sound Ethics, a leading advocate for creator empowerment through ethical innovation, gave us the opportunity to explore some of the most cutting-edge AI music generation models in the space, including Suno and Udio, just to name a few. In this ongoing cat-and-mouse game of AI music creation and detection, our role was to develop a detection tool that could generalize across different AI generation models. We conducted extensive research and identified three benchmark papers as our starting point. Drawing from their architectures, which included both CNN-based and Transformer-based models, we introduced additional training data to help our detection model identify AI-generated songs from nearly every major music generator on the market, with high confidence.

One of our key achievements was increasing out-of-sample classification accuracy from the benchmark's 20% to nearly 90%.

Through the course of this work, we discovered that the key to building a robust detection model wasn't just architecture, it was data diversity. We assembled a comprehensive dataset that included both AI-generated and human-created music from various sources, ensuring our model could generalize across different musical styles and generation techniques.`,
